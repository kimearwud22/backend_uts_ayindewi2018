        Backend Development at GDF focuses on frontend facing backend solutions the so-called Backend For Frontends or
        BFFs. A BFF purpose is to provide relevant data to a specific frontend journey application in a clean and well
        documented way. To make the ownership, the code and the documentation clean, one BFF should only serve one
        frontend application. Having this clean separation is essential to be able to make independent product design
        decisions in the customer facing frontend layer.

        owners, frontend and internal service experts. This close collaboration is essential to fully understand how a
        frontend application collects and visualizes data provided by the customers.
